# Tailored Resumes

This folder contains AI-tailored resumes generated by the pipeline orchestrator.

## File Naming Convention

```
{timestamp}_{company}_{job_title}_final.pdf    # Final compiled PDF
{timestamp}_{company}_{job_title}_final.tex    # Final LaTeX source
{timestamp}_{company}_{job_title}_v1.tex       # Iteration 1
{timestamp}_{company}_{job_title}_v1_score.json # Iteration 1 score
{timestamp}_{company}_{job_title}_v2.tex       # Iteration 2 (if needed)
{timestamp}_{company}_{job_title}_jd_analysis.json # JD analysis
```

## Example

For a Google Software Engineer application on Jan 19, 2026 at 10:30:00:

```
20260119_103000_Google_Software_Engineer_final.pdf     # Use this!
20260119_103000_Google_Software_Engineer_final.tex     # LaTeX source
20260119_103000_Google_Software_Engineer_jd_analysis.json
20260119_103000_Google_Software_Engineer_v1.tex
20260119_103000_Google_Software_Engineer_v1_score.json # Score: 78%
20260119_103000_Google_Software_Engineer_v2.tex
20260119_103000_Google_Software_Engineer_v2_score.json # Score: 92% ✓
```

## How to Use

### For Pending Manual Uploads

1. Check `logs/pipeline/` for jobs pending upload
2. Find the `*_final.pdf` file for that job
3. Upload to the application (tab should still be open)

### Viewing Scores

Each `*_score.json` file contains:
```json
{
  "overall_score": 92,
  "keyword_score": 95,
  "skills_score": 88,
  "missing_keywords": ["kubernetes", "terraform"],
  "suggestions": ["Add infrastructure automation experience"]
}
```

### Compiling LaTeX Manually

If PDF compilation failed, you can compile manually:

```bash
cd resume/tailored
pdflatex {filename}_final.tex
```

Or upload to Overleaf.

## Cleanup

Old tailored resumes can be safely deleted after applications are complete.
Keep PDFs for jobs you're still interviewing with.
