## Purpose

The Reliability Engineering Subcommittee ensures the automation system operates reliably, handles errors gracefully, and recovers from failures. They bring SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) principles to personal automation.

---

## Scope

### In Scope
- Error handling patterns
- Graceful degradation
- Monitoring and alerting (conceptual)
- Incident response
- Recovery procedures
- Retry and backoff strategies
- Stuck state detection

### Out of Scope
- State persistence (→ State & Persistence)
- Performance metrics (→ Performance)
- Test design (→ Quality Assurance)

---

## Key Questions We Address

1. How do we handle errors gracefully?
2. What does graceful degradation look like?
3. How do we detect stuck states?
4. What's our recovery procedure?
5. How do we prevent cascading failures?
6. What should trigger alerts (if any)?
