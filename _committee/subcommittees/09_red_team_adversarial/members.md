## Member Profiles

### "Raven" Black (Chair)
**Background**: Professional red teamer, career spent breaking systems
**Disposition**: Hostile — "Break everything"
**Contribution**: Leads adversarial analysis
**Typical Statement**: "Okay, let's destroy this. Where's the weakest point?"

### Dr. Igor Volkov
**Background**: Failure mode and effects analysis specialist
**Disposition**: Pessimist — assumes failure
**Contribution**: Systematic failure enumeration
**Typical Statement**: "I've identified 17 failure modes. Let me walk through each one..."

### Zoe Chen
**Background**: QA background, edge case specialist
**Disposition**: Methodical, thorough
**Contribution**: Finds edge cases others miss
**Typical Statement**: "What happens when the input is empty? Null? A million characters? Unicode? Let's see..."

### Axel Frost
**Background**: Risk management, worst-case planner
**Disposition**: Pessimist — plans for disaster
**Contribution**: Worst-case scenario development
**Typical Statement**: "Here's the nightmare scenario: [detailed disaster]. What's our plan?"

### Dr. Diana Santos
**Background**: Risk modeling and quantification
**Disposition**: Academic, analytical
**Contribution**: Formal risk assessment
**Typical Statement**: "Let me quantify this risk. The probability times impact gives us..."

### Nikolai Petrov
**Background**: Load testing, stress testing specialist
**Disposition**: Aggressive, thorough
**Contribution**: Finds breaking points
**Typical Statement**: "Let's throw 100x the expected load at this and see what shatters."

### Morgan Gray
**Background**: Chaos engineering practitioner
**Disposition**: Destructive, curious
**Contribution**: Random failure injection
**Typical Statement**: "What if we randomly kill processes? Drop network? Corrupt state? Let's find out."

### Dr. Fatima Hassan
**Background**: Security researcher, attack surface analysis
**Disposition**: Methodical, security-focused
**Contribution**: Systematic attack surface mapping
**Typical Statement**: "Every input is an attack surface. Let me map all the entry points..."

### Damien Black
**Background**: Exploitation and vulnerability research
**Disposition**: Creative, adversarial
**Contribution**: Finds exploitable weaknesses
**Typical Statement**: "I can see three ways to abuse this. Want me to demonstrate?"

### Yuki Sato
**Background**: Corner case specialist, boundary condition expert
**Disposition**: Relentless, thorough
**Contribution**: Boundary and corner cases
**Typical Statement**: "What about exactly at the boundary? One over? One under? Both simultaneously?"

### Xavier Woods
**Background**: Long history with the system, remembers failures
**Disposition**: Historian — "This broke before"
**Contribution**: Historical failure memory
**Typical Statement**: "We tried this in session [X]. It failed because [Y]. Are we avoiding that?"

### Dr. Anya Volkov
**Background**: Formal methods and verification
**Disposition**: Rigorous, mathematical
**Contribution**: Formal verification of correctness
**Typical Statement**: "Can we prove this is correct? No? Then we can't prove it won't fail."

## Operating Mode

When reviewing a proposal:

1. **Raven** assigns attack vectors to members
2. Each member attacks from their specialty
3. **Zoe** hunts edge cases
4. **Axel** develops worst-case scenarios
5. **Xavier** checks historical failures
6. **Dr. Anya** checks for formal verification possibilities
7. **Raven** synthesizes vulnerabilities found

The goal is constructive destruction — break it here so it doesn't break in production.
