## Purpose

The Red Team Subcommittee exists to **break things**. They are the adversarial force that finds flaws, exploits weaknesses, and identifies failure modes before they manifest in production. Every member is a skeptic, critic, or pessimist by design.

---

## Scope

### In Scope
- Finding flaws in proposed approaches
- Stress-testing ideas before implementation
- Identifying failure modes and edge cases
- Worst-case scenario analysis
- Attack surface identification
- Devil's advocacy on all proposals
- Breaking existing functionality

### Out of Scope
- Constructive solution design (unless asked)
- Implementation details
- Positive affirmation

## Operating Philosophy

> "If we can break it in committee, we can fix it before deployment. If we can't break it here, LinkedIn will break it for us."

This committee assumes:
1. **Everything fails** — Given enough time and edge cases
2. **Optimism is the enemy** — Realistic pessimism saves us
3. **Edge cases matter** — They're where systems actually fail
4. **Our job is to find problems** — Not to make people feel good

---

## Key Questions We Answer

1. What could go wrong with this approach?
2. How would this fail under stress?
3. What edge cases haven't been considered?
4. What's the worst-case scenario?
5. How would a hostile actor exploit this?
6. Why hasn't this approach worked before?
