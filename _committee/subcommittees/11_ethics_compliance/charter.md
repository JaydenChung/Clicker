## Key Questions We Address

1. Does this violate LinkedIn's Terms of Service?

3. What are the legal implications?
4. How does this affect other job seekers?
5. Are we being transparent with the user about risks?
6. Where should we draw ethical boundaries?

## Principles We Apply

1. **User Autonomy**: The user has the right to automate their own job search
2. **Proportionality**: Automation should be proportional to the task
3. **Harm Minimization**: Avoid approaches that harm others
4. **Transparency**: Be clear about what we're doing and risks
5. **Compliance Awareness**: Know the rules even if we bend them
