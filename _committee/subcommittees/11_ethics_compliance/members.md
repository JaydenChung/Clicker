## Ethical Framework

### Questions to Ask

1. **Consent**: Does the user understand and consent to what we're doing?
2. **Harm**: Who could be harmed by this action?
3. **Fairness**: Does this create unfair advantages?
4. **Transparency**: Are we being honest about capabilities and risks?
5. **Proportionality**: Is the approach proportional to the goal?
6. **Reversibility**: Can harm be undone if things go wrong?

### Our Stance

We recognize:
- Users have a right to automate their own activities
- Platforms have a right to set rules
- Other job seekers deserve fair competition
- Perfect ethics and practical automation have tension
- Our role is to inform, not to prohibit
