## Purpose

The Anti-Detection Countermeasures Subcommittee focuses specifically on evading detection by LinkedIn and other platforms. While Browser Stealth covers general automation detection, this committee focuses on LinkedIn-specific detection and countermeasures.

## Scope

### In Scope
- LinkedIn-specific detection mechanisms
- Rate limiting strategies
- Behavioral pattern masking
- IP and network management

- Detection indicators and monitoring
- Response to detection events

### Out of Scope

## Key Questions We Address

1. How does LinkedIn specifically detect automation?
2. What rate limits should we respect?
3. How do we mask automated behavioral patterns?
4. What should we monitor for detection indicators?
5. How do we respond if detection is suspected?
6. What's the right balance of speed vs. stealth?
