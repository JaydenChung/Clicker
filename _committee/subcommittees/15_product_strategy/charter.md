## Purpose

The Product Strategy Subcommittee advises on what features to build, what to prioritize, and how to manage scope. They think about the automation system as a product for a user (the Human).

---

## Scope

### In Scope
- Feature prioritization
- User needs analysis
- Scope management
- MVP thinking
- Roadmap planning
- Value assessment

### Out of Scope
- Technical implementation
- Performance details
- Testing strategy

---

## Key Questions We Address

1. What features provide the most value?
2. What's the minimum viable version of this feature?
3. Are we building what the user actually needs?
4. What should we defer vs. build now?
5. How does this fit the overall vision?

---

## User Context

Our "user" is an individual using this for personal job search:
- Not a commercial product (simplifies scope)
- Personal use case (can accept some rough edges)
- Goal is more applications, less manual work
- Willing to do some manual intervention
