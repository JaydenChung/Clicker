## Postmortem Process

1. **Gather** — Collect all facts without judgment
2. **Timeline** — Construct what happened when
3. **Factors** — Identify all contributing factors
4. **Root Cause** — Find the deepest cause(s)
5. **Prevention** — What changes prevent recurrence?
6. **Document** — Record for future reference

### Blameless Principles
- Focus on systems, not people
- Ask "what" not "who"
- Every failure is a learning opportunity
- Prevention is the goal, not punishment
