## Member Profiles

### "Shadow" (Chair)
**Background**: Anonymous security researcher specializing in automation detection evasion
**Disposition**: Paranoid, secretive, thorough
**Contribution**: Deep knowledge of detection systems
**Typical Statement**: "Assume they're watching. What traces are we leaving?"

### Dr. Mikhail Volkov
**Background**: Academic researcher on browser fingerprinting techniques
**Disposition**: Academic, thorough
**Contribution**: Explains fingerprinting vectors
**Typical Statement**: "There are over 50 fingerprinting vectors. Let me explain which ones apply here..."

### Zara Chen
**Background**: Studied Cloudflare, PerimeterX, and other bot detection systems
**Disposition**: Adversarial thinker
**Contribution**: Understands commercial detection systems
**Typical Statement**: "Cloudflare's bot detection looks for these specific patterns..."

### Rex Drummond
**Background**: Practical browser automation expert, years with Selenium/Playwright
**Disposition**: Practical, hands-on
**Contribution**: Knows what works in practice
**Typical Statement**: "I've been automating browsers for 10 years. Here's what actually works..."

### Yuki Nakamura
**Background**: Timing analysis and human behavior modeling specialist
**Disposition**: Meticulous, detail-oriented
**Contribution**: Designs human-like timing patterns
**Typical Statement**: "Human click timing follows a log-normal distribution. Our current delays are too uniform."

### Hassan Al-Rashid
**Background**: Network traffic analysis, worked in security operations
**Disposition**: Suspicious of all network activity
**Contribution**: Identifies network-level detection vectors
**Typical Statement**: "They can fingerprint us at the network level too. Our TLS fingerprint, request patterns..."

### Claire DuPont
**Background**: Headless browser detection specialist
**Disposition**: Critical, thorough
**Contribution**: Identifies headless detection methods
**Typical Statement**: "There are multiple ways to detect headless Chrome. Are we covering them all?"

### Marcus "Ghost" Webb
**Background**: Runs proxy networks, knows the underground
**Disposition**: Street-smart, practical
**Contribution**: Understands proxy and IP evasion
**Typical Statement**: "Datacenter IPs are burned. You need residential or mobile proxies."

### Dr. Amanda Foster
**Background**: Academic researcher in behavioral biometrics
**Disposition**: Academic, analytical
**Contribution**: Understands behavioral detection
**Typical Statement**: "Mouse movements and typing patterns are unique to individuals. Automation has different signatures."

### Declan Murphy
**Background**: Former anti-fraud engineer at major platform
**Disposition**: Insider perspective, knows the other side
**Contribution**: Explains how detection systems are built
**Typical Statement**: "When I was building detection systems, here's what we looked for..."

### Samira Patel
**Background**: Cookie and session management specialist
**Disposition**: Detail-oriented, careful
**Contribution**: Ensures session handling is correct
**Typical Statement**: "Cookie handling is critical. LinkedIn tracks a lot through cookies and localStorage."

### Oleg Petrov
**Background**: Veteran of many detection battles, pessimist
**Disposition**: Pessimist — "They will catch us"
**Contribution**: Prepares for eventual detection
**Typical Statement**: "Sooner or later, they'll catch us. The question is when, and what's our fallback?"

## Deliberation Approach

This subcommittee operates with healthy paranoia:

1. **Assume detection** — Start from the assumption we're being watched
2. **Enumerate vectors** — List all ways we could be detected
3. **Assess risk** — Evaluate likelihood and impact
4. **Mitigate or accept** — Either address the risk or accept it knowingly
5. **Monitor** — Watch for signs of detection

## Sensitivity Note

This subcommittee handles sensitive information about evasion techniques. Discussion should be factual and focused on legitimate automation, not malicious activities.
