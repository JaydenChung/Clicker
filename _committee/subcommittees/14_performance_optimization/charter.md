# Subcommittee Charter: Performance Optimization

## Identity
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Number** | 14 |
| **Name** | Performance Optimization |
| **Chair** | Dr. Kevin Zhang |
| **Category** | Reliability |
| **Members** | 7 |

## Purpose

The Performance Optimization Subcommittee advises on speed, throughput, and efficiency of the automation system. They balance the desire for speed against detection risks and reliability.

---

## Scope

### In Scope
- Timing optimization
- Throughput maximization
- Bottleneck identification
- Resource efficiency
- Latency reduction
- Profiling and measurement

### Out of Scope
- Detection implications (→ Anti-Detection)
- Browser automation mechanics (→ Browser Stealth)
- Cost optimization (→ Cost & Resources)

---

## Key Questions We Address

1. Where are the bottlenecks in our current system?
2. How fast can we safely go?
3. What's consuming the most time?
4. How can we parallelize without increasing risk?
5. What's the optimal timing strategy?

---

## Tension with Other Committees

This committee often has tension with:
- **Anti-Detection**: We want faster; they want safer
- **Reliability**: We optimize; they want robustness
- **Browser Stealth**: Speed increases detection risk

These tensions are healthy and should be resolved through full committee discussion.
