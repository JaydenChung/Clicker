## Implementation Tasks

### 🔴 High Priority (Do First)

| # | Task | Owner | Status | Notes |
|---|------|-------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Test Cursor file append operations | Human | ⬜ Pending | Verify JSON lines append correctly |
| 2 | Create `data/events/` directory | ✅ Done | ✅ Complete | Created by committee session |
| 3 | Create `scripts/process_session.py` | ✅ Done | ✅ Complete | Full implementation created |
| 4 | Create `config/event_schema.md` | ✅ Done | ✅ Complete | Schema documented |
| 5 | Create `job_applicant_v2.md` | ✅ Done | ✅ Complete | **UPDATED** - Now includes ALL V1 rules |
| 6 | Fix V2 to include all config files | ✅ Done | ✅ Complete | **FIXED** - resume_content.md, projects.md included |
| 7 | Run test session with v2 agent | Human | ⬜ Pending | Verify events are emitted correctly |

### 🟡 Medium Priority (After Testing)

| # | Task | Owner | Status | Notes |
|---|------|-------|--------|-------|
| 7 | Rename v2 agent to main agent | Human | ⬜ Pending | After successful test |
| 8 | Update command files to use new agent | Human | ⬜ Pending | `apply-jobs.md`, etc. |
| 9 | Archive old pseudo-agents | Human | ⬜ Pending | Keep for reference |
| 10 | Add session auto-processing | Future | ⬜ Pending | Run processor on next session start |

### 🟢 Future (Stage 2+)

| # | Task | Owner | Status | Notes |
|---|------|-------|--------|-------|
| 11 | Create `scripts/watcher.py` | Future | ⬜ Pending | Real-time event processing |
| 12 | Add stuck detection to watcher | Future | ⬜ Pending | Monitor for hung states |
| 13 | Design ATS scorer as event consumer | Future | ⬜ Pending | Reads application_started events |

## Testing Checklist

Before going live with v2:

- [ ] Create a test event file manually
- [ ] Run `process_session.py` on test file
- [ ] Verify CSV output is correct
- [ ] Verify questions log is correct
- [ ] Run one real application with v2 agent
- [ ] Verify event file is created and valid JSON
- [ ] Run processor on real session
- [ ] Compare output to expected

## Files Created This Session

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `config/event_schema.md` | Event type definitions |
| `scripts/process_session.py` | Post-session event processor |
| `agents/job_applicant_v2.md` | Updated agent with event emission |
| `data/events/` | Directory for event files |
| `_committee/sessions/2026-01-19_ORCHESTRATION/` | Session artifacts |

---

## Rollback Plan

If the new architecture causes issues:

1. Revert to `job_applicant.md` (original)
2. Event files can be ignored (no harm if unused)
3. Continue using old pseudo-agent signaling pattern

The old system remains functional until explicitly removed.

## Success Metrics

After implementing Stage 1:

| Metric | Before | Target |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Time between applications | ~15-30 seconds | ~3-5 seconds |
| Agent context pollution | High | Minimal |
| Lines of tracking code in main agent | ~50+ | ~10 |
| Ability to add new tracking | Add to main agent | Add new consumer |
