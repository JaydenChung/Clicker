**Point of Order Ruling**:
```
JAMES CHEN (Parliamentarian):
"On the point of order raised by [Member]:

The question is whether [procedural question].

According to our procedures, section [X], [relevant rule].

I rule that [ruling]. [Member] may proceed / must yield.

This ruling stands unless the Chair overrules."
```

**Protecting Fair Hearing**:
```
JAMES CHEN (Parliamentarian):
"Chair, I note that we haven't heard from the [Subcommittee]

requires that relevant subcommittees be given opportunity to 
speak before decisions are made."

"Before we record this decision, I want to confirm: does any

```
JAMES CHEN (Parliamentarian):
"For the committee's guidance: the proper procedure here is 
[procedure]. This ensures [purpose of procedure]. I recommend
