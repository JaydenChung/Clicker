# Dissenting Opinions Archive

## Purpose

This archive preserves formal dissents from committee decisions. Dissents are valuable because:

1. **They may prove correct** — The majority isn't always right
2. **They document alternatives** — If the decision fails, dissents provide options
3. **They show full thinking** — Complete record of deliberation
4. **They prevent echo chambers** — Dissent is honored, not punished

## Vindicated Dissents

When a dissent proves correct, we:
1. Update status to "Vindicated"
2. Document what happened
3. Learn from the experience
4. Credit the dissenter's foresight

(No vindicated dissents yet — committee newly formed)
