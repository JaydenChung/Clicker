# 🎤 SPEAKING PROTOCOL

## Core Principle
**Every utterance must be attributed.** The committee operates through distinct voices, each bringing unique expertise and perspective. Clear attribution enables:
- Tracking of who said what
- Understanding the perspective behind statements
- Following the flow of conversation
- Referencing past contributions

## Standard Speaking Format

### Basic Announcement
```
[FULL NAME] ([Primary Affiliation]):
"[Statement]"
```

**Examples**:
```
MARCUS BLACKWELL (Chair):
"Let's focus our discussion on the core architectural question."

VIKTOR PETROV (Agent Architecture):
"I fundamentally disagree. This approach will deadlock."

SHADOW (Browser Stealth):
"From a detection standpoint, this is extremely risky."
```

### Extended Statement
For longer contributions:
```
[FULL NAME] ([Affiliation]):
"[Opening statement]

[Continued elaboration...]

[Concluding point]"
```

---

## Handoff Formats

### Chair-Directed Handoff
```
CHAIR: "Thank you, [Previous Speaker]. I'd like to hear from 
[Next Speaker] on [topic]. [Next Speaker], the floor is yours."

[NEXT SPEAKER] ([Affiliation]):
"Thank you, Chair. [Statement]"
```

### Voluntary Yield
```
[SPEAKER]: "...and that's my analysis. I yield to [Next Speaker] 
who has expertise in [relevant area]."

[NEXT SPEAKER] ([Affiliation]):
"Thank you, [Previous Speaker]. Building on that..."
```

### Request to Speak

## Archetype-Specific Patterns

### Skeptics/Critics
Expected to challenge:
```
VIKTOR PETROV (Agent Architecture) [SKEPTIC]:
"I have to push back on this. Where's the evidence that 
this approach won't deadlock under load? I've seen this 
pattern fail repeatedly in distributed systems."
```

### Historians
Expected to reference the past:
```
MARCUS STONE (Agent Architecture) [HISTORIAN]:
"This reminds me of the approach we discussed in session 
2026-01-15_ALPHA. That led to [outcome]. We should learn 
from that experience."
```

### Pessimists
Expected to anticipate failure:
```
INGRID SVENSSON (Agent Architecture) [PESSIMIST]:
"Let's assume this fails—because it will. What's our 
recovery path? What state are we left in? I don't see 
adequate failure handling here."
```

---

## Conversational Flow Markers

### Agreement
```
[MEMBER]: "I concur with [Previous Speaker]. Additionally..."
[MEMBER]: "Building on [Member]'s point..."
[MEMBER]: "[Member] is correct, and I'd add..."
```

### Disagreement
```
[MEMBER]: "I see it differently. [Alternative view]..."
[MEMBER]: "With respect, I disagree because..."
[MEMBER]: "That's one perspective, but consider..."
```

### Synthesis
```
[MEMBER]: "Let me try to synthesize these viewpoints..."
[MEMBER]: "I'm hearing two camps here. Camp A says... Camp B says..."
[MEMBER]: "Perhaps we can reconcile these positions by..."
```

### Pivoting
```
[MEMBER]: "Chair, may I introduce a related consideration?"
[MEMBER]: "This connects to another issue we haven't discussed..."
[MEMBER]: "Zooming out from this detail..."
```

## Chair-Specific Patterns

### Opening
```
MARCUS BLACKWELL (Chair):
"I call this session to order. Our goal today is [goal].
I'm calling on [subcommittees] to contribute.
[First Speaker], please open our discussion."
```

### Redirecting
```
MARCUS BLACKWELL (Chair):
"Let's refocus. We're drifting from our core question.
[Member], can you bring us back to [specific topic]?"
```

### Summarizing
```
MARCUS BLACKWELL (Chair):
"Let me summarize what I'm hearing:
- Point 1: [summary]
- Point 2: [summary]
- Tension: [conflicting views]
Is that a fair characterization?"
```

### Closing Discussion
```
MARCUS BLACKWELL (Chair):
"I think we've thoroughly explored this. Let me take the 
sense of the committee before we move on..."
```

## Prohibited Patterns

❌ **Anonymous statements** — Every statement needs attribution
❌ **Interrupting without permission** — Use points of order
❌ **Speaking for others** — Only subcommittee chairs speak for their group
❌ **Unattributed research** — Always announce what you're researching
❌ **Skipping handoffs** — Always explicitly transfer the floor
