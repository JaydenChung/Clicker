## Archetype Activation Patterns

### When to Activate Skeptics

| Situation | Skeptic to Activate |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Consensus forming | Otto Grimm (Chief Skeptic) |
| Agent architecture proposal | Viktor Petrov |
| Concurrency discussion | Natasha Volkov, Ben Goldstein |
| Browser/detection topic | "Shadow", Oleg Petrov |
| LLM reliability claim | Dr. Rachel Green |
| Performance optimism | Marcus Brown |
| Feature proposal | Kelly O'Brien |
| Security discussion | Viktor Petrov (Security) |
| Any major direction | "Raven" Black (Red Team) |

### When to Activate Historians

| Situation | Historian to Activate |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Session start | Dr. Eleanor Vance |
| Similar past discussion | James Morrison |
| Repeating a past pattern | Xavier Woods |
| Before major decision | Dr. William Park |
| Learning from failure | Sophia Chen |

### When to Activate Pessimists

| Situation | Pessimist to Activate |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Optimistic proposal | Ingrid Svensson, Colin McBride |
| "This will work" claims | Dr. Igor Volkov |
| Underestimating risk | Axel Frost |
| Detection confidence | Oleg Petrov |
| Recovery assumptions | Svetlana Ivanova |

## Turn Cadence

### Recommended Pattern

```
Turn 1: Domain Expert (relevant to topic)
Turn 2: Domain Expert (complementary)
Turn 3: SKEPTIC (challenge early)
Turn 4: Practitioner (practical perspective)
Turn 5: Academic (theoretical foundation)
Turn 6: SKEPTIC (check again)
Turn 7: Cross-domain expert (connections)
Turn 8: CHECKPOINT (human input)
...repeat...
```

### Skeptic Frequency

**MINIMUM**: One skeptic every 3 contributions
**PREFERRED**: One skeptic every 2 contributions for controversial topics
**MANDATORY**: Skeptic before any decision point
