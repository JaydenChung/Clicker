## Session Context Management

### Context Budget
- Reserve 20% context for session wrap-up
- Monitor context usage throughout
- Warn at 70% usage
- Begin wrap-up at 80% usage

### What Consumes Context
- Each page snapshot
- Form field interactions
- Log file updates
- Error handling

### Optimization Tips
- Don't re-snapshot unless page changed
- Batch log updates where possible
- Skip redundant confirmations

## Personal Profile Reference

The agent should consult `config/personal_profile.md` for:
- User's name, email, phone
- Work authorization status
- Sponsorship requirements
- Resume filename (must be uploaded to LinkedIn)
- Experience levels for various technologies
- Default answers for common questions

**CRITICAL**: If an answer is NOT in the profile, the agent MUST:
1. Log the question to `logs/questions/unanswered.md`
2. Use a reasonable default or skip if optional
3. Note what answer was used

**SETUP REQUIRED**: Users must fill out `config/personal_profile.md` before running!

---

## Safety Rules

1. **Never** apply to the same job twice
2. **Never** submit incomplete required fields
3. **Always** complete an application once started (don't abandon mid-form)
4. **Always** log every application attempt
5. **Stop** if rate limited or errors exceed threshold
6. **Preserve** all logs even on error

---

## After Each Session

The human should:
1. Review `logs/questions/unanswered.md` and update `config/personal_profile.md`
2. Check `logs/performance/stuck_log.md` for recurring issues
3. Review `logs/applications/_index.md` for application status
4. Update `config/job_preferences.md` if search needs adjustment
