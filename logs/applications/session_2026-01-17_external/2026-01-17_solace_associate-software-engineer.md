## Questions Answered

### Q1: Why does Solace's mission resonate with you?
**Answer Provided**:
Healthcare accessibility is deeply important to me. Having seen family members struggle to navigate the complexity of the US healthcare system, I understand the real impact that patient advocacy can have. Solace's mission to pair patients with expert advocates resonates because it addresses a fundamental problem - 88% of adults cannot navigate healthcare without help. I want to build technology that makes a tangible difference in people's lives, and helping patients get better outcomes through better navigation is exactly that.

### Q2: Share code you're proud of
**Answer Provided**:
I'm particularly proud of the AI-powered story maze game I built for CruzHacks 2025, which won 1st Place "Best Education Hack." It's a full-stack application with a Python FastAPI backend and React TypeScript frontend. Users enter a prompt and GPT generates a branching narrative with multiple choice paths. What makes it special is the seamless integration of AI-generated content with dynamic state management. I built a recursive story generation system that maintains narrative coherence across branches. The technical challenge was optimizing API calls while keeping the UX smooth. It demonstrated my ability to ship a complete, polished product under a tight deadline.
